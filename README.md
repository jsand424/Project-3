###1. Purpose of our Project

The primary purpose of this project is to analyze hospital infection control data to identify
patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs). By interpreting and visualizing these data, we aim to provide
comprehensive and actionable insights that can help healthcare professionals and
hospital administrators improve infection control measures, consequentially reducing the
incidence of HAIs.  

####3. Data Source and Public Interest

The dataset “Healthcare Associated Infections - Hospital”
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadfaizan65/hospital-infections-dataset?resour
ce=download was sourced from Kaggle.  

This dataset is highly relevant to public health as it addresses a critical aspect of patient
safety within healthcare settings. HAIs are a significant concern worldwide, leading to
increased patient morbidity, extended hospital stays (Zimlichman et al., 2013) and
additional healthcare costs (Mitchell et al., 2019). By analyzing this dataset, we aim to
contribute to public health awareness and promote more effective infection control
strategies.  

######4. Data Safety and Legal Consideration

● Data Safety: The dataset contains anonymized and aggregated data, which means no
personally identifiable information (PII) is included. This reduces the risk of violating
patients’ sensitive information.

● Legal Considerations: The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle which implies that it
has been shared under terms that allow for public use. Therefore, it is used ethically and
responsibly. We will ensure compliance with all relevant data protection laws and
guidelines, such as ThefulltextoftheGeneralDataProtectionRegulation(GDPR), by not
including any PII and using the data solely for educational and research purposes.  

######Data visualization path  

We aim to create at least three data visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas,
Matplotib, Plotly, or JavaScript. These visualizations can present data insights clearly and
interactively.  

Goal:  

To assess and improve hospital infection control practices by analyzing performance against
national benchmarks, identifying areas for improvement, and understanding regional and
measure-specific trends
